## Treeware

Currently, you're free to use this extension. I would highly appreciate you buying the world a tree in return.

It’s now common knowledge that one of the best tools to tackle the climate crisis and keep our temperatures from rising above 1.5C is to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-48870920">plant trees</a>. If you contribute to our forest you’ll be creating employment for local families and restoring wildlife habitats.

You can buy trees at for our forest here [offset.earth/treeware](https://plant.treeware.earth/freshbitsweb/laravel-traveller)
